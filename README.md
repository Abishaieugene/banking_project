hello my code viewers!

Banking System Project Overview:

Features:

Initial Balance: Users start with an initial balance of Rs 10,000.

Minimum Balance Requirement: Users are required to maintain a minimum balance of Rs 500 at all times.

Flexible Withdrawals: Users can withdraw funds anytime, provided they maintain the minimum balance.

Deposit Functionality: Users can deposit money into their account.

Transaction History: The system supports multiple transactions, allowing users to view their account details and balance updates.

Implementation:
Account Management: I implemented a BankAccount class to manage account details, including the account number, holder name, and balance.

Transaction Methods: The system includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds while ensuring that the minimum balance constraint is enforced.

User Interaction: Utilized a console-based menu system for user interaction, allowing users to choose between displaying account details, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, or exiting the system.

Balance Checks: Added functionality to check if the balance falls below the minimum required amount and exit the system with a thank-you message if the balance does.

Output:
Account Details: Displays the account number, account holder name, and current balance.

Transaction Confirmation: Shows messages confirming deposits and withdrawals, along with any errors if the minimum balance requirement is not met.

Exit Messages: Provides clear exit messages when the user chooses to exit or when the balance drops below the minimum threshold.

Real-Time Application:
This project simulates real-world banking operations, making it a practical tool for understanding financial management. It is suitable for use in educational settings, demonstrating fundamental concepts of account management, transaction processing, and constraint enforcement.
